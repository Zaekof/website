title: StrawPoll Overlay for Twitch users

---

On *[Twitch](https://twitch.tv)* it's easy to find tools to launch StrawPoll, the problem being that it is often not configurable as we would like, with the styles we would like.

That's why I released on Github the *StrawPoll* project for Twitch, it can be embedded on your Stream like an overlay, the project is open-source, so easily modifiable (you need a programming base to make really push changes).

![enter image description here](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/5f870193503613e46643cd2ea6c43ba05f59e59d/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f4c394941386b682e676966)

The StrawPoll overlay has been designed to be integrated into software (obs/streamlabs obs/ etc...) to send a live stream to the Twitch platform. If you do not use Twitch to stream, the overlay will not work.

I am still working on the project, you too can help the project to move forward by adding your personal touches.
