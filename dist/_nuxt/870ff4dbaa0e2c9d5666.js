If you do not use Twitch to stream, the overlay will not work.\r\n\r\nI am still working on the project, you too can help the project to move forward by adding your personal touches.\r\nThe Project can be found here: *[https://github.com/Zaekof/Twitch-StrawPoll](https://github.com/Zaekof/Twitch-StrawPoll)*"}}]);
