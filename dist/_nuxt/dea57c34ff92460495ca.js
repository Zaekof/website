I work for *[MasterSnakou](https://twitch.tv/mastersnakou)* and *[Paranoi4k](https://twitch.tv/paranoi4k)* and many others streamers... .\r\n\r\nIn this article I will tell you about the overlay project for *[Paranoi4k](https://twitter.com/paranoi4k)*.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this overlay is to be able to display all the information in one place, in order to group everything together. Based on a CyberPunk video: [https://youtu.be/vjF9GgrY9c0?t=556](https://youtu.be/vjF9GgrY9c0?t=556) (look at the top right), this was one of Paranoi4k's requirements.\r\n\r\nSo I based myself on this video with the CyberPunk style, adding a few colors and animations here is what it looks like.\r\n\r\n![enter image description here](https://i.imgur.com/cE6SNbw.gif)\r\n\r\nThe overlay displays the new subscribers, but also the latest donations, the largest donation of the month, but also at the top of the overlay, the total donations, the total number of subscribers and the various Paranoi4k networks."}}]);
